\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}L@{\hspace{1.2em}}J@{}} 

\edudate{\scshape Aug 2018} & \textbf{Machine Learning Engineer \& Graduate Researcher} \\
\edudate{\scshape Present} & Data Science Lab -- \textsc{University of New Mexico, USA}\\ [0.3em]

\edudate{\href{https://github.com/}{\textbf{DSX} \blueExtArrow}} &
\textbf{Designed} and led development of an \textbf{LLM-based state detection framework}, integrating \textbf{foundation models}, \textbf{representation learning}, and \textbf{explainable AI} to identify latent states and generate insights in multivariate streaming data. Enabled new research in \textbf{time-series explainability} and tool adoption. \\[2.7em]

\edudate{\href{https://github.com/}{\textbf{DRUM} \blueExtArrow}} &
\textbf{Architected} and \textbf{operationalized} DRUM, a robust \textbf{unsupervised learning platform} for \textbf{change point detection} and \textbf{real-time inference} in streaming data. Improved \textbf{regime shift detection}, reduced anomaly response by 30\%, and published results at DAWAK 2023, with ongoing references by peer researchers.\\[2.7em]

\edudate{\href{https://github.com/}{\textbf{TSX} \blueExtArrow}} &
\textbf{Designed} a production-ready \textbf{SmartGrid analytics solution}, leveraging \textbf{deep learning} and \textbf{predictive analytics} for automated fault detection, event forecasting, and real-time data visualization. Enhanced \textbf{data-driven decision making} and increased grid reliability for infrastructure stakeholders.\\[3.5em]

\edudate{\scshape Apr 2025} & \textbf{Lead Data Steward} \\
\edudate{\scshape Present} & Department of Workforce Solutions -- \textsc{State of New Mexico, USA}\\ [0.3em]

\edudate{\href{https://github.com/}{\textbf{DRIFT} \blueExtArrow}} & \textbf{Designed and launched} DRIFT, a secure, enterprise-scale data access and orchestration platform, embedding \textbf{real-time anomaly detection}, \textbf{data governance}, and automated \textbf{compliance} enforcement to support high-volume, high-sensitivity data streams for state operations. Led the cross team implementation, standardizing access and monitoring across 10+ business units, streamlining analytics for mission critical workflows, and reducing end-to-end data request turnaround by 40\%. Recognized internally as a catalyst for modernizing statewide data management practices.\\[6.9em]

\edudate{\scshape Dec 2016} & \textbf{\href{https://www.opentech.fund/}{OTF Fellow~\blueExtArrow}} \\
\edudate{\scshape Dec 2017} & Radio Free Asia -- (\textsc{Open Technology Fund)} \& {\scshape{University of New Mexico, USA}}\\ [0.3em]

\edudate{\href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/}{\textbf{Bot-D} \blueExtArrow}} & \textbf{Conducted} and managed large-scale, real-time social media analytics for \textbf{election data integrity}, deploying cutting-edge \textbf{bot detection}, \textbf{anomaly analytics}, and \textbf{automated monitoring} on multi-million tweet datasets. Drove collaboration with election integrity NGOs, producing actionable reports and open datasets that informed policy recommendations and were cited in international academic publications.\\[4.0em]

\edudate{\href{https://github.com/}{\textbf{AV} \blueExtArrow}} & \textbf{Designed} and implemented advanced \textbf{information security} and \textbf{malware detection} models using \textbf{machine learning}, \textbf{statistical modeling}, and \textbf{risk modeling} techniques. Led research on novel web-based attack vectors and collaborated with global cybersecurity partners to deploy countermeasures, ultimately improving detection rates and supporting the development of policy recommendations for transnational security.\\[1.5em]
